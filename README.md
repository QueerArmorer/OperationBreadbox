# OperationBreadbox
A public, open source method for using python to interact with multiple Google Sheets documents.

8/3: A group conversation of various people (please add or expand on your name here if you were in that chat: QA, C, B, J, G, O, K, L) launched the idea of Operation Boxcar, a way of combining multiple google sheets onto simple HTML documents that can be shared to make sharing resource lists during disasters easier.

The idea is you can maintain a google sheet fairly easily but if lots of people need to access an easy to use on your phone, narrow variant of one (or multiple) google sheets, Google's own apps fail at aiding navigation and due to the variety of phones and devices needed to rapidly be deployed to a new app wouldn't solve the issue all the time, while a simple HTML drop down system would.

I wrote some very rough bones. It uses Flask as a web development framework, make sure that and gspread are installed on your system first. I managed to get it functioning on a basic level when hand customized but due to several stacked personal emergencies I didn't have the time to return to it. those are the ones here as of 8/3. They wrote this and are hoping that this starts a chain of documentaion on here, albeit with manual adjustments. I'm uploading the files as they sit hoping someone can take this framework and implement it but much, much better.
